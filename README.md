[Pantry](https://getpantry.cloud/) is a free service that provides perishable data storage for small projects. Data is securely stored for as long as you and your users need it and is deleted after a period of inactivity. Simply use the restful API to post JSON objects and we'll take care of the rest.

It was built to provide a simple, re-usable storage solution for smaller sized projects. It was created by developers for developers, to be there when you need it and to help you rapidly prototype your next project.
